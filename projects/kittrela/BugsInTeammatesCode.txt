Title: Adventurer Card will Draw Only 1 Treasure, if 1 or more Treasure Cards Are in Deck + Discard

Class: Serious Bug

Date: 5/26/17

Reported By: Andrew Kittrell

Reproducible: Yes

Description
==============
Playing the adventurer card with at least 1 treasure card in the deck + discard will cause the adventurer card to only pick up 1 treasure. The program stops searching after the first treasure is found. 

Steps to Reproduce
=================
Set the game state such that 1 or more treasures are in the discard + deck (it doesn’t matter, as a shuffle will occur if there are none currently in the deck). Play the adventurer card. 

Expected Results
==============
If there are a minimum of 2 treasures in the deck, I expect them to be drawn from the deck and placed into my hand.

Actual Results
============
Only one treasure is placed in my hand.
